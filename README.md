# Object-Detection-BeginnerLevel

This project has been made to learn and practice the basic concepts of OpenCV. It is a beginner level project and it is focused on to detect objects like "Cell phone", "Person", "Scissors"... I put some buttons on the frame so that wou may select what to detect. Hopefully, will implement better Computer Vision projects near future. I would like to receive any kind of feedback/improvement about my project.
